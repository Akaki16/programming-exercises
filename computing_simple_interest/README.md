## Description

Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for
the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time,
and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).

The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where P is
the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest, t is the
number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount
at the end of the investment.

## Example Output

`Enter the principal` : `1500`

`Enter the rate of interest` : `4.3`

`Enter the number of years` : `4`

After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will
be worth $1758.
