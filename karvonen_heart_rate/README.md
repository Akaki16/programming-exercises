## Description 

Create a program that prompts for
your age and your resting heart rate. Use the Karvonen for-
mula to determine the target heart rate based on a range of
intensities from 55% to 95%. Generate a table with the results
as shown in the example output. The formula is

Formula: `TargetHeartRate = (((220 − age) − restingHR) × intensity) + restingHR`

## Example Output

`Resting Pulse: 65`   `Age: 22`

`Intesity %`  |  `Rate bpm`
 --------       --------
 `55%`      | `138 bpm`
 `65%`      | `145 bpm`
 `70%`      | `151 bpm`
 `75%`      | `.......` (extra lines omitted)
 `80%`      | `178 bpm`
 `85%`      | `185 bpm`
 `90%`      | `191 bpm`
